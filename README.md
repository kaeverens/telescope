# telescope
website and arduino code for my telescope

mostly self-explanatory.

create a website out of the www directory. it will need the `vals.json` file to be writable. it also needs a writable `images` directory in the directory as `vals.json`. I haven't added any authentication. I run mine in my local network. it is *assumed* that anyone that has access to the website has authority to upload images and settings.
